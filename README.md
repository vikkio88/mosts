# mosts
mosts - the Manager of the hOsts (cygwin utility)

mosts is a stupid shell script which allow you (on cygwin) to manage windows hosts file.

I have just call put a bunch of hosts file in ~/.hostsT and then run cygwin as admin.
To change host file: 
 $ mosts c(change) 3 -> this will change your hosts file with the hosts3 file which is in your ~/.hostsT folder
To show current hosts file:
 $ mosts s(show)
